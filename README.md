# 🏥 Medical Insurance Customer Segmentation & Cost Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project applies **Unsupervised Machine Learning** techniques to analyze a medical insurance dataset. The goal is to perform **Customer Segmentation** and identify **high-risk customer groups** to optimize insurance pricing strategies.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Data Preprocessing:** Label Encoding, Feature Scaling, and Outlier Detection.
* **Feature Selection:** Removed highly correlated features (Multicollinearity check) using Heatmap analysis.
* **Clustering:** Applied **K-Means Clustering** with the **Elbow Method** to determine optimal segments.
* **Dimensionality Reduction:** Visualized high-dimensional data using **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**.
* **Business Insight:** Identified the most expensive customer profiles for cost management.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **Python 3.x**
* **Pandas & NumPy** (Data Manipulation)
* **Seaborn & Matplotlib** (Visualization)
* **Scikit-Learn** (K-Means, PCA, Preprocessing)
* **Yellowbrick** (Elbow Method Visualization)

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup
This project uses a dedicated Conda environment for reproducibility.
